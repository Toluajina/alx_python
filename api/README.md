Requirements

General
Recommended editors: Visual studio code
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(**import**("my_module").**doc**)')
You must use get to access to dictionary value by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
Your code should not be executed when imported (by using if **name** == "**main**":)

TASKS

1. Gather data from an API: Write a Python script that, using this REST API, for a given employee ID, returns information about his/her TODO list progress.

NB: The endpoint for access specific TODO items for an employee with ID = 1 will be https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1/todos and the endpoint to get specific employee details will be https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1

Requirements:

You must use urllib or requests module
The script must accept an integer as a parameter, which is the employee ID
The script must display on the standard output the employee TODO list progress in this exact format:
First line: Employee EMPLOYEE_NAME is done with tasks(NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS/TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS):
where:
EMPLOYEE_NAME: name of the employee
NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS: number of completed tasks
TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS: total number of tasks, which is the sum of completed and non-completed tasks
Second and N next lines display the title of completed tasks: TASK_TITLE (with 1 tabulation and 1 space before the TASK_TITLE)

2. Export to CSV: Using what you did in the task #0, extend your Python script to export data in the CSV format.

Requirements:

Records all tasks that are owned by this employee
Format must be: "USER_ID","USERNAME","TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS","TASK_TITLE"
File name must be: USER_ID.csv

3. Export to JSON: Using what you did in the task #0, extend your Python script to export data in the JSON format.

Requirements:

Records all tasks that are owned by this employee
Format must be: { "USER_ID": [{"task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS, "username": "USERNAME"}, {"task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS, "username": "USERNAME"}, ... ]}
File name must be: USER_ID.json

4. Dictionary of list of dictionaries: Using what you did in the task #0, extend your Python script to export data in the JSON format.

Requirements:

Records all tasks from all employees
Format must be: { "USER_ID": [ {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, ... ], "USER_ID": [ {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, ... ]}
File name must be: todo_all_employees.json
